# TMPettyCache #

## hybrid in-memory/on-disk cache for iOS and OS X ##

`TMPettyCache` is an asynchronous (thread-safe) wrapper for NSCache that transparently persists cached data to disk, as well as providing block-based callbacks for important cache-related events that you care deeply about as a developer and as a human being.

This document will be improved, in the meantime enjoy perusing the example project.
